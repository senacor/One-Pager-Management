# Photo Quality label model

We have trained our own image labeling model with the photo-classifier sub project.
You can get the trained weights from the GitHub release
[Photo Quality Model V1](https://github.com/senacor/One-Pager-Management/releases/tag/photo-quality-v1).

To use it in the application unzip the model weights in this dir.
