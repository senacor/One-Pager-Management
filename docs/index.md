## About OnePagers

OnePagers are documents similar to CVs that the company uses to promote employees to customers. A OnePager contains:

- Name and Position
- Photo
- Short list of skills and focus areas
- Work experience (including university) and certifications
- List of projects

The OnePagers are currently PowerPoint files stored on SharePoint. These sub-projects aim at automating working with the existing documents and also replacing them with new data collection methods and document generation.
